# Parking-Space-Counter-using-Machine-learning

A **smart parking space detection & counter** implemented in Python.  
This project detects and counts available parking spaces using computer vision / machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

Finding a parking spot in crowded lots consumes time and contributes to traffic.  
This project aims to simplify parking by **automatically detecting available parking slots** in a video or image feed and providing a **real-time parking space count**.

## Features

✔️ Automatically detects parking spaces  
✔️ Counts occupied vs free spots  
✔️ Works with images & video streams  
✔️ Easy to adapt to different parking layouts  


## How It Works

1. Read a static image or video of a parking lot  
2. Use computer vision techniques (e.g., contour detection / ML)  
3. Identify parking space regions  
4. Detect if a space is occupied or free  
5. Display results in real-time
